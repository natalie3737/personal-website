## 📁 Experience

### Helios Healthcare Advisors - Software Engineering and Analyst Intern (Summer 2024)

A healthcare real estate company, at Helios I helped to develop the first iteration of a **full-stack web application** that is going to be used to help value and compare different healthcare properties. Using Medicare and Medicaid data, I used *Flask, React, Python, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL* to help create this app, and later deploy it through Azure.
